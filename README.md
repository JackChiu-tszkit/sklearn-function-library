### **📌 scikit-ml-functions**  
*A comprehensive collection of essential scikit-learn machine learning functions*  

---

## **📖 Overview**  
This repository contains implementations of key **scikit-learn machine learning functions** for **classification, regression, clustering, and dimensionality reduction**. The goal is to provide ready-to-use code snippets for anyone working with **scikit-learn**.

## **📂 Contents**  

### **1️⃣ Classification** (Supervised Learning)  
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**
- **Stochastic Gradient Descent Classifier (SGDClassifier)**
- **Naive Bayes (MultinomialNB)**
- **Support Vector Classifier (SVC)**
- **Ensemble Classifiers (RandomForestClassifier)**  

### **2️⃣ Regression** (Supervised Learning)  
- **Stochastic Gradient Descent Regressor (SGDRegressor)**
- **Lasso Regression**
- **ElasticNet Regression**
- **Support Vector Regressor (SVR)**
- **Ridge Regression**
- **Ensemble Regressors (RandomForestRegressor)**  

### **3️⃣ Clustering** (Unsupervised Learning)  
- **K-Means**
- **Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM)**
- **MiniBatch K-Means**
- **MeanShift**
- **Variational Bayesian Gaussian Mixture Model (VBGMM)**  

### **4️⃣ Dimensionality Reduction** (Feature Engineering)  
- **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**
- **Isomap**
- **Spectral Embedding**
- **Locally Linear Embedding (LLE)**

## **🚀 Installation**  
Make sure you have Python and scikit-learn installed. You can install all dependencies using:  

```bash
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib
```

---

## **📌 Usage**  
You can find the implementation of each function in the respective script files inside the repository. Below is an example usage of the **KMeans Clustering** algorithm:

```python
from sklearn.cluster import KMeans

# Example dataset (replace with real data)
train_X = [[1, 2], [2, 3], [3, 4], [5, 6], [8, 8]]

# Train model
model = KMeans(n_clusters=2, random_state=1)
model.fit(train_X)

# Predict cluster labels
predictions = model.predict(train_X)
print(predictions)
```

Each script follows a similar structure with **training, fitting, and prediction**.
